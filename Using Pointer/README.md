# Matrix Transpose

This program finds the transpose of any `m`x`n` matrix using C.  
The matrices **are not** Multi-dimensional arrays, but are Dynamically allocated using the `malloc()` function.  
This allows the matrix to be of any dimension.  
  
The Transpose of the matrix is determined using `pointers`.
